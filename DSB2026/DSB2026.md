## Information about Venice

**Travel.** Venice is conveniently served by [Venice Marco Polo Airport](https://www.veniceairport.it/en/), located on the mainland approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) north of Venice. For additional travel options, the nearest alternative airport is Treviso’s [Antonio Canova Airport](https://www.trevisoairport.it/en/). From either airport, you can easily reach Venice by bus, water shuttle, or train; see the [arriving-by-plane](https://events.veneziaunica.it/en/plan-your-trip/arriving-by-plane) Venezia Unica webpage for detailed information. On top of that, the main train station, [Venezia Santa Lucia](https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html), is well connected, with regular regional and high-speed trains from throughout Italy.

**Getting Around in Venice.** For getting around Venice, the public waterbus service (vaporetti) is the most convenient option. You can check real-time schedules, routes, and stop information using the website and app [CheBateo](https://chebateo.it/). It's a helpful tool to plan your trips across the old city and nearby islands efficiently.

**Tourism.** For information on attractions, historical sites, guided tours, and events, you can visit the official tourism website of Venice: [Venezia Unica](https://www.veneziaunica.it).

## Accommodation

Venice and Mestre offer a wide range of accommodation options. You can stay in Mestre (for example, [Hotel Alexander](https://www.hotelalexander.com/)) and reach the city center easily by public transport, taking 10–15 minutes by train or bus. Alternatively, you can stay in Venice old town, within walking distance of the conference venue (for example, [Albergo Marin](https://www.albergomarin.it/), ~10 minutes; [Hotel Sangallo](https://hotelsangallo.com/), ~25 minutes).
