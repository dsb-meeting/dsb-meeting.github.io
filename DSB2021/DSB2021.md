# How to participate
To participate you need to register (step 1/2) and potentially, to submit an abstract (step 2/2).


<u>Deadline:</u> January 27

### 1/2: Registration (mandatory)

* Participation is free, but registration is mandatory. Registrations are now closed.

## Important Notice

**All participants should have received an email with the instructions for joining the workshop.** If you have not received such an email,
please contact Yuri Pirola (yuri.pirola@unimib.it) as soon as possible.

### 2/2: Submit an abstract

As previously, there is no formal review, and the organizers reserve the  right to select talks from the submissions to obtain a diverse and  interesting program.

## Program

The workshop has been live streamed on YouTube. You can find the links to the individual talks in the program.
